                                            ADVANTAGES OF ARRAY:-

1> Allow continuos memory allocation. 
2> Access Time T(n)=O(n).
3> Can store multiple data of same type using single variable.

                                           DIS-ADVANTAGE OF ARRAY:-

1>. Insertion at time complexity T(n)=O(n).
2>. Deletion time complexity T(n)=O(n).
3>. Size of array should be known in advance.
4>. Wastage of memory if data is stored as per the size declared.
